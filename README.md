## Prerequisites (w/ GitHub account)
If you have a GitHub account, there are no specific requirements to get started with Vector
Application Framework - Community Edition except for a web browser! Just click the **Code** icon in
the top right corner of this page and select **Create codespace on main** as illustrated below.

This will open a Microsoft Visual Studio Code instance in a Container that is based on the Docker
image as provided via Packages of this repository. All tools and dependencies of Vector Application
Framework - Community Edition are pre-installed, just ready to use!

>**ℹ️ Note** The initial creation of a Codespace takes a few moments, mainly due to the download of
> the Docker image. On subsequent access, previously created instances are still available and can
> be re-used. Even changes are persisted. That means, one can start a project and continue at any
> later point in time.

## Prerequisites (w/o GitHub account)

If you don't have a GitHub account or prefer to work directly on your local machine, we recommend
the following tool setup:
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (for Windows users only)
* Docker (recommended to install using the apt repository)
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code with *Dev Containers* extension

The following steps are needed to set up the environment locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/vectorgrp/application-framework.git`
2. Open the just cloned folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Wait for the prompt of the *Dev Containers* extension to re-open the folder in the container.

>**ℹ️ Note** The initial startup takes a few moments, mainly due to the download of
> the Docker image.
4. That is the setup complete. You are now ready to start with one of our provided examples in 📂 [Tutorials](Tutorials).
